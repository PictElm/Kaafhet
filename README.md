# Kaafhet

**The Battle of Kaafhet** was originally based on [Age Of Empires 2](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aoeii/) with the idea of replacing the players with AIs competing against each other.

> Note: the main branch is the `cleanup` one, not the `master` one.

## TODO: *

> The `old/` folder currently contains the whole and only (and messy) documentation I made for this project (in French)&hellip; _(you should always do your documentation before forgetting everything!)_

> Also the game is missing the graphic part and the natural-world generation&hellip;
